## Installation

To install all dependencies and build the site:

```
npm run install-all
# You'll see errors during this step because some of the framework tests
# fail. That's be design, so don't worry :) At the end it should print the
# message "Site built successfully!". If you don't see that then something
# actually did break :P
npm run build
npm start
```

## What is this?

Karma tests for each of the major frameworks to see how they handle working
with Web Components.
